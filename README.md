Countdown Generator is a React application that allows you to create countdowns for various events such as birthdays, holidays, and special occasions. With this app, you can generate countdown links by providing the name of the event, day, and month. If the event date has already passed in the current year, the countdown will automatically adjust to the next year's date.

## Features

- Event Details: Input the name of the event, day, and month to create a countdown.
- Dynamic Countdown: If the event date has passed this year, the countdown adjusts to the next year's date.
